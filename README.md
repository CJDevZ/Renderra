## ✅ Features
- Adds a **video player** that can play any video directly on **Text Displays**.
- Fully works with **vanilla clients** — optional mod installation for viewers.

## 🌷 ResourcePack
⚠️ Download [`ResourcePack.zip`](https://github.com/CJDevZ/Renderra/releases/tag/ResourcePack) and apply it if you aren't already playing with this mod.

## 📖 Usage
1. Press `B` (default, configurable keybind) to open the video player screen.
2. Use **Axiom** to select the **Text Display** that will act as the video screen.
3. Once the display is selected, you can:
- Choose a video/gif from the `videoplayer` folder in your instance.
- Select the desired **resolution**.
- Generate the **audio track** for the selected video, which will be saved in the `videoaudio` folder.

## 🔊 Audio Streaming
1. Download [`ResourcePack.zip`](https://github.com/CJDevZ/Renderra/releases/tag/ResourcePack).
2. Move the generated audio files into the `assets/renderra/sounds` folder within.
3. Apply the `ResourcePack.zip` to your client and share it with others so everyone can hear the audio.

📝 Tip: Use `ADD_SCREEN` mode to add or edit Text Displays. Turn it off afterward to prevent accidental changes.
